**The Creator Browser wakes “God Mode” for your desktop application app.exe.**

After installing Creator, you get a tiny 180KB application launcher proxy.exe.
If your desktop app is app.exe, simply copy proxy.exe into the same folder as app.exe and rename it appProxy.exe.

Launch app.exe for normal mode; launch appProxy.exe to enter God Mode.
proxy.exe launches app.exe as the Creator Browser’s Browser Process, then exits immediately, playing no further role.
In God Mode, your application becomes an application content ecosystem interpreter:
It can transform web pages, XML, or LLM content descriptions into dynamic interfaces.
Native windows (such as Chromium browser windows, WinForm, MFC CView, etc.) are treated as tokens, dynamically composing the UI like a webpage.

No changes to the original code or recompilation are needed—your app instantly becomes a super composite UI generator.
